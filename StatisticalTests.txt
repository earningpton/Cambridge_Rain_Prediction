Statistics Test:													
1. Normality Tests		check if your data has a Gaussian distribution											
Shapiro-Wilk Test		whether a data sample has a Gaussian distribution											
D’Agostino’s K^2 Test		whether a data sample has a Gaussian distribution											
Anderson-Darling Test		whether a data sample has a Gaussian distribution											
	if reject = not Gaussian												
2. Correlation Test			if two samples are related										
Pearlson:	Assume normal		test linear relationship										
Spearman:	Assume one is not, rank first			test monotonic relationship									
Kendall:			test monotonic relationship										
Chi-Squared Test		whether two categorical variables are related or independent.											
3. Stationary Tests			check if a time series is stationary										
Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test				whether a time series has a unit root, e.g. has a trend or more generally is autoregressive									
Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin				whether a time series is trend stationary or not									
4. Parametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests				compare data samples									
Student’s t-test		whether the means of two independent samples are significantly different											
Paired Student’s t-test		whether the means of two paired samples are significantly different											
Analysis of Variance Test (ANOVA)				whether the means of two or more independent samples are significantly different.								F-test	explained var/unexp var = between group/within group
Repeated Measures ANOVA Test			whether the means of two or more paired samples are significantly different.										
5. Nonparametric Statistical Hypothesis Tests													
Komolgorov-Smirnov Test			whether the distributions of two independent samples are equal or not.							KS test is sensitive to any differences in the two distributions			
Mann-Whitney U Test			whether the distributions of two independent samples are equal or not.							MW test has been extended to handle tied values, eg categorical			
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test			whether the distributions of two paired samples are equal or not.										
Kruskal-Wallis H Test			whether the distributions of two or more independent samples are equal or not								>= 2 group		
Friedman Test			whether the distributions of two or more paired samples are equal or not								>= 2 group		
	Paired = order matter, iid = order doesn't matter
